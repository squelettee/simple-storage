### Project Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to interact with a smart contract on the Sepolia testnet from a ReactJS frontend using the ethers.js library. The project provides a simple interface where you can:

- Connect to the Sepolia network.
- View details of your account including your address, balance, and network.
- View the value stored in the smart contract through a simple call.
- Modify this value by signing and paying transaction fees.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the interactions with the Sepolia testnet!
